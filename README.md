## Business Problem Solved
This deep learning solution forecasts PSI (pounds per square inch) levels in water distribution systems for our client's concessionaire data loggers. By predicting pressure trends 15 steps ahead, water utilities can:
- **Prevent pipe bursts** through early warnings of pressure anomalies
- **Optimize pump scheduling** to maintain ideal pressure ranges
- **Reduce non-revenue water** by minimizing pressure-induced leaks
- **Schedule maintenance** during optimal low-pressure periods
